# climate-change-in-africa

# Objectives
The objective of this checkpoint is to analyze the 'Climate change in Africa' dataset by visualizing temperature fluctuations across five African countries from 1980 to 2023, focusing on specific tasks like plotting temperature trends, comparing histograms of temperature distributions, and determining the most effective chart for representing average temperatures per country.

# Instructions

In this checkpoint, we will work on the 'Climate change in Africa' dataset provided by the U.S global change research program.

Dataset description: This dataset contains historical data about the daily min, max, and average temperature fluctuation in 5 African countries (Egypt, Tunisia, Cameroon, Senegal, and Angola) between 1980 and 2023.
